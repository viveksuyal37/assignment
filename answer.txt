Ans1) output will be ---->

40
NaN
-----------------------------------------------------
explanation: we have a circle object which has a radius property and two methods (diameter and perimeter).

when we call diameter method (circle.diameter()), this method returned this.radius *2.

since it is a normal function so here this keyword is refering to circle object itself. Therfore its returned value is (circle.radius * 2)=40. 

In perimeter function, as it is a arrow function so there this keyword will refer to the global object(in node) and the returned statement will be evaluated as return 2 * (pi value) * {};

so multiplying any number with the object will give Nan(not a number).

In browser this inside a arrow function will refer to window object.


Ans 2)


const date = new Date();

let day = date.getDate();
let month = date.getMonth() + 1; //since it uses indexes same like array.
let year = date.getFullYear();
let hours = date.getHours();
let minutes = date.getMinutes();
let seconds = date.getSeconds();

let formatedDate =
  day + "-" + month + "-" + year + " " + hours + ":" + minutes + ":" + seconds;

console.log(formatedDate);


Ans 3)

all required imports here..


function App() {

    const input=useRef()

useEffect(()=>{
  input.current.focus() 
},[])

return(
    <div>
         <input type="text" ref={input} ></input>
    </div>
)
}
